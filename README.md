# Kalakriti
Kalakriti lets you experience traditional painting techniques in Virtual Reality.

Through this prototype, we wish to provide the user with experience of Indian Craftsmanship. Since most of the crafts involve the art styles and paintings, we focussed our attention on creating those artforms in 3D. 

For the implementation, we used the code base of A-Frame and used their a-painter[1] to build our prototype. We further provided an environment which resembled to that of original setting where the craftsmanship is practiced. We also provided with a narrative story in the background which gave an immersive user experience. To restrict the user from getting away from the original artform of the handicraft, we provided a template which can be followed with the help of the brushes needed for crafting the handicrafts.

### How to run Locally (on your machine)
1. Clone the Git Repo.
2. (Extract if required) Now go inside the Cloned directory and create a virtual environment.
